# Anomaly-Based-Intrusion-Detection-
* This Repository contains the code to detect intrusions inside a network
* The Intrusion detection system uses anomaly based method to detect intrusions

# Dataset Used
KDD-Cup 1999 dataset

# Model Used
The Intrusion Detector is built using Aritificial Neural Network, which is trained specifically for each individual type of attacks

# How to Run?
Run the file IDS.py in an IPython Notebook, to trace step by step analysis of what code does
